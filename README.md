# calculator-app
Calculator application using Java swing.

First time experimenting with the GUI features of Java. much of the raw programming was done using NetBeans' GUI editor. I mostly programmed the logic. The calculator program has similar functionality and 'look' to its MacOS counterpart.

All numbers and operands were assigned to a String arraylist. String operands are then converted into integer types, which are used for computation. 

Other features:
- Keyevent listeners
- Text-size reduction with addition of characters
- Copy/paste/close commands (couldn't get CTR+V working)
- Input filter (from PASTE)
- General math expression logic (PEMDAS)
